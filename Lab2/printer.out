Dear Professor O'Neil,

I am so sorry that I am unable to turn in my program at this time.
First, I ate a rotten apple, which made me turn red and extremely ill.
I came down with a fever of 105. Next my beautiful pet lion must have
smelled the remains of the apple on my computer, because he ate it. I am
currently rewriting the program and hope you will accept it late.

Sincerely,
(Paul Murage)
